## Available Scripts

Clone the repository and run npm install.
In case npm install shows any errors, you can run this command instead:<br/>
npm install --ignore-scripts --no-lockfile --production --no-global --legacy-peer-deps --force

In the project directory, you can this run:

### `npm start`
This will open the application on localhost:3000

It is also an npm package, the source code is available here:
https://github.com/Pukhta2704/node-react-validator

In the application I have included the source code of the validator in the src file so you guys can have a look.

Apart from that I haven't used any thrid party css libraries for this application and it is coded in pure css. 
Here is a video demonstration of the application:
